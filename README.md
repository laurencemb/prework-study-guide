# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this site as an aid to my front end development course, to both practice the lessons I was learning as well as to prive a place to store notes in an ordered and accessible fashion. 

I learnt about basic html, css and javascript both individually as well as how they work together within an individual web application.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this tool simply open the application in the browser and read the notes. They are dividided in to sections by topic. If you need help deciding whcih topic to start with, right click and select inspect to open the web development browser in google chrome, select console and there will be a new suggestion each time you reload the page. 

## Credits
